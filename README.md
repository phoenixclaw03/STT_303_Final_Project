# STT_303_Final_Project
Analysis of gene expression in the following data set:
[i don't know how you found the annotations dataset. i can't find it anymore.)

Age data found from brain_amygdala under https://www.gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/bulk_tissue_expression#bulk_tissue_expression-gtex_analysis_v10-rna-seq-Gene_read_counts_by_tissue-container

To reproduce: Read and append the datasets, make a heatmap with a small segment of the data. It's recommended to look at smaller chunks of the data at a time so the program can run effectively, as the final dataset has over 50,000 entries.
