Age and Sex related data:
Obtained from cervix and fallopian tube gene expression data.

To reproduce: Read and append the datasets, make a heatmap with a small segment of the data. It's recommended to look at smaller chunks of the data at a time so the program can run effectively, as the final dataset has over 50,000 entries.
